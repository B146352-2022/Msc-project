# Msc-project
model_function.ipynb contains all basic functions that I used in the project
one_hot.ipynb contains the functions that I processed the innput and output data for CNN model
CNN nonSHM.ipynb is the scirpt that I trained the CNN model with nonSHM datasets
CNN_hyper.ipynb is the script that I optimize the hyperparameters on the CNN model
LSTM.ipynb is the scirpt that I trained the RNN model with nonSHM dataset
shm.ipynb is the scirpt that I trained the RNN model with SHM dataset
LSTM_hyper.ipynb is the script that I optimize the hyperparameters on the RNN model
shm_hybrid.ipynb is the scirpt that I trained and evaluated the hybrid model
hybrid_hyper.ipynb is the scirpt that I optimized the hyperparameters on the hybrid model
